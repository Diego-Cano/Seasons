###Seasonal Cherry Blossom App
Welcome to the Seasonal Cherry Blossom App! This application provides an interactive and visually appealing way to explore the beauty of cherry blossom trees throughout the different seasons in Seattle. Users can view stunning images of cherry blossoms set against iconic Seattle backdrops, including the Space Needle and Mount Rainier, for each seasonâ€”Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter. Each seasonal view comes with detailed information, such as the first and last day of the season, average rainy and sunny days, and average temperatures. Additionally, users are given clear instructions on how to navigate through the app by clicking on the cherry blossom images to move to the next season.

One of the unique features of this app is the interactive experience during the winter season, where users need to click multiple times on the cherry blossom image to transition to the next season, adding an element of fun and engagement. The app is built using Jetpack Compose for a modern and intuitive user interface, and it employs vibrant background colors that change according to the season, enhancing the overall user experience. We hope you enjoy using the Seasonal Cherry Blossom App and find it both beautiful and informative!
